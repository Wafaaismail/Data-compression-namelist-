Encoding algorithm (4 bit lengths)

1) Count the number of 0s between two 1s

2) If the number is less than 15, write it down in binary form.

3) If it is greater than or equal to 15, write down 1111, and a following binary number to indicate the rest of the 0s. If more than 30, repeat this process.

4) If the data starts with a 1, write down 0000 at the beginning.

5) If the data ends with a 1, write down 0000 at the end.
6) Send the binary string

Decoding algorithm (4 bit lengths):

Group all the bits into 4-bit groups.

1) For each 4-bit group, write down that number of 0s.

2) If at the end of the bit string, stop.

3) If not at the end of the bit string:  If the 4-bit group was less than 15, write down a 1. Go to step 1.  If the 4-bit group is 15, go to step 1.
